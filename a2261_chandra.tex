A2261 has two \emph{Chandra} exposures of 10 and 25 ksec (ObsIDs 550 and 5007, respectively), which do not conclusively reveal any accretion onto a SMBH.  The X-ray flux is those data is dominated by 0.5--2\,keV emission from hot cluster gas, showing a cooled core \citep{2005MNRAS.359.1481B}.  Above 2\
,keV, there are is some emission, possibly a point source consistent with knot 4, though it is far too faint to reliably distinguish it from cluster gas emission.  Deeper \emph{Chandra} observations can better reveal low-level accretion onto a SMBH and has the angular resolution to localize a point source such that it can be determined whether it is in one of the knots or at the core photometric center.  For example, if the black hole has a mass of $10^{10}\,\msun$, and it is emitting in the 2--7\,kEv band at an Eddington fraction of $10^{-6}$ as a power-law with photon index $\Gamma = 1.9$, a 100 ksec observation would detect 5 photons in the band, sufficient for significant detection above the background.  Such an observation would also be sensitive to a bow shock created by a recoiling SMBH and thus could provide strong positive evidence if it exists.
